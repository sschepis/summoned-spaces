# Prime Resonance Network Identity Management System
## High-Level System Description

### Executive Summary

The Prime Resonance Network (PRN) Identity Management System is an enterprise-class, quantum-enhanced identity and domain management platform that serves as the foundational layer for the next generation of decentralized identity infrastructure. By combining traditional identity management principles with quantum-inspired operations through [`ResoLang`](../assembly/resolang.ts:1) integration, the system provides unprecedented security, scalability, and flexibility for identity verification, access control, and digital asset management.

- **Quantum-Enhanced Security**: Leverages quantum-inspired operations for unhackable authentication and tamper-proof audit trails
- **Hierarchical Domain System**: Enables scalable organization structures with inherited permissions and ownership
- **Progressive KYC Verification**: Four-tier verification system from basic email validation to comprehensive background checks
- **Enterprise-Ready Compliance**: Full audit trail system with tamper-resistant logging for regulatory compliance

## System Architecture

### 1. Identity Layer
The foundation of the system, supporting multiple identity paradigms:

#### **Self-Sovereign Identities**
- Users maintain complete control over their identity
- Cryptographic key-based authentication
- Privacy-preserving by design
- Compatible with existing blockchain and DID standards

#### **Managed Identities**  
- Enterprise or domain-controlled identities
- Delegated permissions and expiration policies
- Integration with existing enterprise identity systems
- Compliance-friendly for regulated industries

#### **System Identities**
- Service accounts and automated system entities
- API access and inter-system communication
- Audit trail for all system-level operations

### 2. Domain Management System

#### **Hierarchical Structure**
- **Root Domains**: Top-level domains registered through the domain registry (e.g., `company.prn`)
- **Subdomains**: Unlimited nesting capability (e.g., `engineering.company.prn`, `backend.engineering.company.prn`)
- **Cross-Domain Operations**: Secure interactions between different domain hierarchies

#### **Ownership & Governance**
- Domain ownership with secure transfer mechanisms
- Member management with role-based permissions
- Domain-specific KYC requirements and policies
- Inheritance rules for permissions and policies

### 3. Digital Object Framework

#### **Object Types**
- **Fungible Objects**: Divisible digital assets (tokens, currency, shares)
- **Non-Fungible Objects**: Unique digital assets (certificates, NFTs, licenses)

#### **Ownership Properties**
- **Transferability**: Objects can be transferred between identities
- **Destructibility**: Objects can be permanently destroyed if authorized
- **Fungibility**: Objects can be split, merged, or fractionalized

#### **Lifecycle Management**
- Creation with configurable properties
- Ownership transfer with audit trail
- Split/merge operations for fungible objects
- Destruction with irreversible finality

### 4. Permission & Access Control System

#### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Global Permissions**: System-wide capabilities (e.g., [`identity.create`](../assembly/identity/interfaces.ts:172), [`domain.manage`](../assembly/identity/interfaces.ts:180))
- **Domain-Specific Permissions**: Custom permissions within domain boundaries
- **Object-Level Permissions**: Fine-grained control over individual assets

#### **Permission Inheritance**
- Hierarchical permission flow through domain structures
- Configurable inheritance rules and propagation depth
- Override capabilities for specific use cases

#### **Capability-Based Security**
- Permissions can imply other permissions
- Complex permission evaluation through quantum-inspired algorithms
- Dynamic permission assessment based on context
